/*
Package novas provides an interface to the Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software (NOVAS).

http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/

To run programs using this package, you will also need a planetary
ephemeris file, called JPLEPH. To create this file, download the files
from this site:

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/fortran/

and follow the instructions in userguide.txt

Those instructions tell you to also download a set of DE files. With set? I don't know. DE405 seems to work fine.
